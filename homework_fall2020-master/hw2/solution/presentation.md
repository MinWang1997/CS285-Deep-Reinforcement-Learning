# 10-minute presentation

## Outline problem + solution




## Difficulties you encountered + how you solved them
- feel lost to implement an algorithm in a lastest paper -> start with simple, try to finish assignment of CS285, which provide a structure way to learn reinforcement learning. 
- linux server hard drive limit for students and MuJoCo configuration failure on Linux -> use my own laptop
- the policy doesn't perform as expected: In experiment 4, the run with both reward-to-go and the baseline should achieve an average score close to 200, but it is only about 150 -> debug
- when I run experiment 3 and specify -n 100 (Number of iterations), my program iterates 199 times and then raise error zsh command not found --discount -> use simple environment and different hyper parameters to test if implemention is correct.

 


## Future work
