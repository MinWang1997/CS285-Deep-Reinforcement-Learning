# tricks
- use much larger batch size
- learning rates:
    
- optimizers:
     - Adaptive step size rules like ADAM can be OK-ish as start point, but regular SGD with momentum is extremely hard to use



# questions
- HOw to test modules independently (either via unit tests or isolated, structured development).



# debug
- using ‘assert’ statements to ensure expected dimensions, ranges, etc.
