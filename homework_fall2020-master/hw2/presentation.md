# 10-minute presentation

## Outline problem + solution




## Difficulties you encountered + how you solved them
- feel lost to implement an algorithm in a lastest paper -> start with simple, try to finish assignment of CS285, which provide a structure way to learn reinforcement learning. 
- linux server hard drive limit for students and MuJoCo configuration failure on Linux -> use my own laptop
- the policy doesn't perform as expected -> debug




## Future work




## Short demo video of the implementation
