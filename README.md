Including:

SRVR-PG implementation in rllab from scratch


Milestone:

✅-25.11.2020 
get a basic knowledge of policy gradient (read blogs/ papers/ taking courses) [2 weeks] 

✅24.11.2020-01.12.2020 
understand the algorithm of the chosen policy gradient method [1 week]

01.12.2020-08.12.2020 
foundation of the implementation of policy gradient method 
• get familiar with the framework 
• understand algorithm pseudocode in the paper) [1 week]

08.12.2020-12.01.2020 
• implement policy gradient SRVR-PG from scratch
• apply it to a simple game for testing
• fix bugs by referring source code on Github (at least 3 weeks) [5 weeks]

12.01.2020-26.01.2021 
prepare presentation and demo video[2 weeks]
• 10-minute presentation
